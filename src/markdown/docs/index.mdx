Propcore components are a collection of neo-constructivist-styled React Tailwind components. Most of the components are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn UI</a>.

Neo-constructivism draws from the 1920s Soviet avant-garde — the bold geometric forms of El Lissitzky, the dynamic diagonals of Rodchenko, and the stark red-black-white palette of revolutionary propaganda posters. It combines that aggressive visual clarity with modern component architecture and interaction patterns.

Where neobrutalism embraces discomfort, neo-constructivism embraces purpose. Every element exists to communicate, not decorate. Sharp angles create tension and movement. Typography tilts and scales to establish hierarchy through visual weight. The restricted palette — revolutionary red, industrial black, paper white — forces intentional design choices.

The original Constructivists believed art should be engineered for social impact, not hung in galleries. These components carry that same philosophy: design as a tool, not an ornament.

I created this collection for builders who want their interfaces to feel urgent, intentional, and unapologetically bold — and for anyone curious about translating a century-old design movement into modern component libraries.
