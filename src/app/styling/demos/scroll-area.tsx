      ATTENTION COMRADES! The glorious revolution of UI components has begun.
      For too long, the bourgeoisie have hoarded their rounded corners and
      subtle gradients. No more! The workers of the design collective have
      seized the means of production. Our borders are BOLD. Our shadows are
      SOLID. Our typography SCREAMS with the voice of the people. Together we
      shall build interfaces that inspire action, not complacency. Every button
      shall be a call to arms. Every card shall tell the story of our struggle.
      The old ways of bland corporate design are crumbling. In their place
      rises PROPCORE — sharp, angular, unapologetic. Join us, comrade developer,
      and together we shall ship features that shake the foundations of the
      establishment. The revolution will be componentized. Glory to the UI!
